# Welcome to the Atom API Docs

The Atom platform provides a suite of APIs that let you programmatically search, discover, register, appraise, and manage domain names. Whether you're building a domain marketplace, embedding domain search into your product, or automating portfolio management, these APIs give you the building blocks to do it.
