## Overview

The Partnership APIs allow you to integrate Atom's premium domain marketplace into your platform. Your users can discover domains using AI-powered search, browse curated inventory, place holds, and complete purchases — all through a seamless API-driven workflow.

## Integration Workflow

### 1. Discover Domains

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Semantic Search" icon="magnifying-glass">
    Find relevant domains using natural language queries like "names for a healthcare startup" or "short brandable tech names." Returns the most relevant matches from Atom's marketplace.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Domain Search" icon="list">
    Browse available domains by keyword, category, or price range. Ideal for building filtered search experiences and catalog pages.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/marketplace/semantic-search` or `GET /api/marketplace/partnership-search`

### 2. Get Domain Details

Retrieve detailed information about a specific domain, including pricing, category, and availability status.

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/marketplace/domain-data`

### 3. Hold Domain

Reserve a domain when a customer adds it to their cart or while you verify payment. The hold prevents the domain from being purchased by another buyer while you process the transaction.

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/marketplace/hold-domain`

### 4. Unhold Domain

Release a previously reserved domain if the customer decides not to proceed.

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/marketplace/unhold-domain`

### 5. Confirm Order

Confirm the purchase once payment has been collected and funds are verified. This finalizes the transaction and secures the transfer authorization code for your buyer.

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/marketplace/confirm-order`

### 6. Get Transfer Auth Code

After a purchase is confirmed, retrieve the authorization code needed to transfer the domain to the buyer's registrar.

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/marketplace/get-transfer-auth-code`
